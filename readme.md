# custom-template
- **What is it?**
	A simple function to take a template file and replace the text you want with whatever you need.

- **How do I use it?**
	1. Download from the `releases` section and extract the package to your `node_packages` folder of your choosing.
	2. Require the module:
	```js
	const createTemplate = require("custom-template");
	```
	3. Call the function that is returned from the require's result with the options of your choosing.

- **How do I remove it?**
	Just remove the folder you installed it to and you're good to go.

- **Why isn't this on NPM?**
	Too lazy to add it and this project isn't very good to begin with, it's just a single function anyway.
